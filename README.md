# Abingdon-EndOf10 Volunteer information, if not a volunteer please visit [oelnbod.github.io/eo10](oelnbod.github.io/eo10).
If you have storage available could you list it in storage.md, we need lots of fast storage and lots of large storage.
We need fast (but slower potentially) storage to facilitate backup of data (which may be required) and fast storage (ideally USB3+, but USB2 does work) for installing the OS (particularly as DVD images are required).

### Some notes on distro
- zorin ~3.8GB
- fedora KDE ~2.8GB
- *fedora kionite* ~3.7GB
- mint ~3GB
- Ubuntu ~5.9GB
- kubuntu ~4.2GB
- xubuntu ~4.0GB
- ChromeOS Flex ~*6.8*GB (the .bin it provides needs to be renamed as a .img) prefer not as not in the spirit of endOf10 and FOSS and *very* large file
- lastOS?
- solus budgie ~3GB (low priority)

When installing distros onto USB sticks, make sure that they are DVD images (i.e., all files are available on the drive), we have very limited bandwidth (I think ~10Mb/s) and I want to prioritise this for packages. Also, flash the drives using Ventoy (even if three is only 1 distro on the drive), this allows us to re-image the drive by only copying files and not requiring us to flash it normally. If Ventoy uses up too much space, as to prevent flashing the drive, then don't use it.
